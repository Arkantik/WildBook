</br>


### Observations ðŸ”Ž: 

Since the whole promo of 70 Wilders was split into 4 differents groups it was more difficult to communicate with other wilders and build relations with them.
Due to the multiple communication platforms we use on the daily basis such as Slack, Google Meet, Discord and others, we also found it rather difficult to centralize the possibility of discussions.
Moreover, it's quite rare to be able to talk with alumnis or professionals composing the Wild Code School.

### Idea ðŸ’¡: 

We thought, why would we not allow all this big community of Wilders to discuss, share and help each others on an innovative and intuitive social platform ?
